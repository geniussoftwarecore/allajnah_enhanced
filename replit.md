## Technology Stack

### Backend
- **Framework**: Flask 3.1.1
- **Database**: SQLite with SQLAlchemy ORM
- **Authentication**: JWT (PyJWT)
- **CORS**: flask-cors
- **Production Server**: Gunicorn

### Frontend
- **Framework**: React 19.1.0
- **Build Tool**: Vite 6.3.5
- **Routing**: React Router DOM
- **UI Library**: Radix UI components
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS 4.1.7
- **HTTP Client**: Axios
- **Package Manager**: pnpm

## Development Setup

### Port Configuration
- **Frontend (Development)**: Port 5000 (0.0.0.0)
- **Backend (Development)**: Port 8000 (localhost)
- **Frontend proxies /api requests to backend on port 8000**

### Running Locally
The project has two workflows configured:
1. **Backend**: Runs Flask development server on port 8000
2. **Frontend**: Runs Vite development server on port 5000

Both workflows start automatically and the frontend is configured to proxy API requests to the backend.

## Deployment Configuration

### Production Build
The deployment process:
1. Installs frontend dependencies with pnpm
2. Builds the React app with Vite
3. Copies the built files to backend's static folder
4. Runs the Flask app with Gunicorn on port 5000

### Deployment Type
- **Type**: Autoscale (stateless web application)
- **Server**: Gunicorn with `--reuse-port` flag
- **Port**: 5000 (production)

## Key Features
- User authentication and authorization
- Role-based access control (Trader, Technical Committee, Higher Committee)
- Annual subscription payment system with admin review workflow
- Complaint submission and tracking
- Report generation
- Arabic language interface (RTL support)

## Recent Changes

### Oct 5, 2025 - Critical Bug Fixes and System Validation
- **Authentication Whitelist Expansion**:
  - Added v2 API routes to subscription_exempt_routes in token_required decorator
  - Routes added: `/api/subscription/me`, `/api/payments`, `/api/renewal/check`
  - Traders can now access subscription info endpoints before activation
  - Fixes: Traders unable to check subscription status or submit payments

- **Grace Period Scheduler Fix**:
  - Fixed critical bug in `check_and_expire_subscriptions()` function
  - Now properly loads `grace_period_days` and `enable_grace_period` from Settings table
  - Corrected expiry calculation: `end_date + timedelta(days=grace_period_days)` when enabled
  - Prevented premature subscription expiration during grace period
  - Missing imports added: `timedelta`, `Settings` model

- **System Validation**:
  - Verified registration and login endpoints working correctly (JWT tokens issued)
  - Confirmed subscription payment flow functional end-to-end
  - Database initialization script tested and working
  - All core features operational and tested

- **Code Quality**:
  - Architect review completed and approved for all changes
  - LSP diagnostics reviewed (minor warnings in init_db.py only)
  - Backend and frontend code structure validated

### Oct 4, 2025 - Renewal and Notification System
- **Complete Renewal and Alert System Implemented**:
  - Database Enhancements: Added renewal tracking fields to Subscription model (is_renewal, grace_period_enabled, notified_14d, notified_7d, notified_3d)
  - Grace Period Support: Configurable grace period (default 7 days) after subscription expiry
  - Renewal Reminders: Automatic notifications at 14, 7, and 3 days before expiry
  - Settings Expansion: Added currency, grace_period_days, and enable_grace_period settings
  
- **Admin Features**:
  - Manual trigger for renewal reminders (/api/admin/check-renewals)
  - Settings initialization endpoint (/api/admin/init-settings)
  - Renewal status checking endpoint (/api/renewal/check)
  - Currency configuration (YER, USD, SAR)
  - Grace period toggle and duration settings
  
- **Frontend Components**:
  - RenewalReminder: In-app banner showing expiry warnings and grace period status
  - Enhanced PaymentSettings: Added currency selection and grace period configuration
  - Dynamic reminder display based on days remaining

- **Renewal Flow**:
  1. System sends notifications at 14, 7, and 3 days before expiry
  2. In-app banner alerts traders about upcoming renewal
  3. After expiry, grace period allows continued access (if enabled)
  4. Payment approval automatically creates renewal subscription
  5. Renewal subscriptions are properly tracked and linked to previous subscriptions

### Oct 4, 2025 - Annual Subscription Payment System
- **Complete Subscription Gateway Implemented**:
  - Database Models: Subscription, Payment, PaymentMethod, Settings
  - Backend API Routes: Subscription management, payment submission, admin review
  - Frontend Components: SubscriptionGate, PaymentPage, PaymentReview, PaymentSettings
  - Security: JWT secret moved to SESSION_SECRET environment variable
  - Receipt Protection: Authentication and authorization required for downloads
  - Comprehensive Enforcement: All Trader routes blocked until subscription active
  
- **Payment Flow**:
  1. Trader registers and attempts to access system
  2. System checks subscription status and blocks access if inactive
  3. Trader views payment methods and submits payment with proof
  4. Admin (Technical/Higher Committee) reviews and approves/rejects payment
  5. Upon approval, subscription activates and Trader gains full access
  
- **Admin Features**:
  - Payment method management (add/edit/delete Yemeni e-wallets and bank accounts)
  - Payment review dashboard with approve/reject functionality
  - Subscription price configuration
  - View all payments with filtering and status tracking

### Oct 4, 2025 - Fresh Clone Setup
- **GitHub Import Re-configured**: Successfully set up fresh clone for Replit environment
- **Dependencies Reinstalled**:
  - Backend: Python 3.11 dependencies via uv (Flask 3.1.1, Flask-CORS, Flask-SQLAlchemy, PyJWT, Gunicorn)
  - Frontend: 390 packages via pnpm 10.4.1 (React 19.1.0, Vite 6.3.5, Tailwind CSS 4.1.7, Radix UI)
- **Workflows Configured**:
  - Backend: `cd complaints_backend && python src/main.py` (console output, port 8000)
  - Frontend: `cd complaints_frontend && pnpm run dev` (webview output, port 5000)
- **Deployment Configured**:
  - Type: Autoscale (stateless)
  - Build: Frontend build + copy to backend static folder
  - Run: Gunicorn serving Flask app on port 5000
- **Testing Verified**:
  - Both workflows running successfully
  - Backend on localhost:8000 (Flask debug mode)
  - Frontend on 0.0.0.0:5000 (Vite HMR)
  - Login page displays correctly with Arabic RTL
  - Vite proxy correctly forwarding /api to backend

### Oct 3, 2025 - Initial Setup
- Database initialized with roles, categories, and statuses
- Pre-existing SQLite database preserved with existing data

## User Preferences
- Language: Arabic (RTL interface)
- Database: SQLite (pre-existing, preserved)

## Important Notes
- The database file (app.db) contains existing data and should not be modified
- Frontend uses Vite's proxy in development to route /api requests to backend
- Production deployment serves the static frontend through Flask
- All API routes are prefixed with /api

## Security Requirements for Production
- **SESSION_SECRET**: Must be set as an environment variable for JWT token signing
  - Development fallback: 'dev-secret-key-please-change-in-production'
  - Production: Configure strong random secret in deployment environment
- **Receipt Files**: Stored in complaints_backend/src/uploads/ with authentication-protected downloads
- **Subscription Enforcement**: Centralized in token_required decorator, blocks all Trader access without active subscription
- **Payment Flow Routes**: Exempted from subscription check to allow payment submission:
  - /api/subscription/status
  - /api/subscription/me (v2)
  - /api/payments (v2)
  - /api/renewal/check (v2)
  - /api/payment-methods
  - /api/subscription-price
  - /api/payment/submit
  - /api/payment/receipt/*

## Testing Status

- **Core Functionality**: All verified working
  - ✅ User registration and login with JWT tokens
  - ✅ Subscription creation and extension
  - ✅ Payment submission and approval
  - ✅ Grace period calculation
  - ✅ Renewal reminders
- **Known Issues**: Some test fixtures outdated but not affecting production functionality
